    <h4>The Tale of Chestnut, the Wandering Prince</h4>

    <p class="chestnut">Once upon a time, in a peaceful village across the sea, there lived a kind and gentle dog named Ju Guo. She had roamed the land freely, watched over by kind humans who cared for her. One day, she gave birth to six tiny puppies, each full of life and wonder.</p>

    <p class="chestnut">The humans who loved Ju Guo wanted the best future for her and her children. A distant land across the ocean offered them new homes, where they could live safe and comfortable lives. And so, Ju Guo and her six little ones set out on a great journey, carried by the wind and waves to a place unknown.</p>

    <p class="chestnut">Among them was a small pup with fur the color of autumn leaves—Chestnut. Even as a baby, he was different. While his siblings played and tumbled, he watched and listened. He was thoughtful, cautious, and wise in a way that no one could quite explain.</p>

    <p class="chestnut">After arriving in this new land, Chestnut and his siblings were welcomed by kind rescuers in a place called Eugene. There, he spent his early days with a foster family, safe but uncertain. He was shy, as if the long journey had left whispers of the past in his heart. But deep down, he was gentle, clever, and patient—waiting for the right home to find him.</p>

    <p class="chestnut">One day, that home arrived. A family saw something special in the quiet little pup and took him into their arms. And so, Chestnut’s journey continued—not alone this time, but with those who truly loved him.</p>

    <p class="chestnut">Together, they traveled far and wide, crossing forests, mountains, and rivers. He lived in the misty woods of Oregon, felt the cool ocean breeze of Maine, watched the falling leaves in Massachusetts, and rested in the peaceful corners of New Jersey. He even journeyed across the great land itself, riding beside his family as the world passed by in a blur of colors and scents.</p>

    <p class="chestnut">Though shy at first, Chestnut soon grew into his true self—a laid-back, gentle soul who had seen enough of the world to know that the best things in life were simple: a warm home, a loving family, and the quiet comfort of knowing he belonged. He was clever, learning tricks in moments, figuring out how to open doors all on his own, eating shoes when family members not watching. He was independent, never needy, yet always close by when his family needed him most.</p>

    <p class="chestnut">Perhaps his many adventures had made him wise beyond his years. Or perhaps, after such a long journey, he had simply decided that his wandering days were over.</p>

    <p class="chestnut">And so, Chestnut, the once-lost traveler, found his forever home—not in any one place, but in the hearts of those who loved him. And there, he lived happily ever after, forever safe, forever loved.</p>
